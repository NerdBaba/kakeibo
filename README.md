## üöÄ Getting Started

As this is a frontend-only prototype contained within a single HTML file:

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get the `kakeibo` directory containing the `index.html` file.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>/kakeibo
    ```
    OR
    Download the `index.html` file directly.

2.  **Open in Browser:** Simply double-click the `index.html` file, or right-click and choose "Open With" your preferred web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

That's it! You can now interact with the user interface.

## üí° Potential Future Enhancements

*   **Data Persistence:** Implement Local Storage or connect to a backend API (like Firebase, Supabase, or a custom REST API) to save and retrieve user data.
*   **User Authentication:** Add sign-up/login functionality.
*   **Functional Actions:** Implement actual edit, delete, search, and filter logic for expenses and budgets.
*   **Data Visualization:** Add charts (e.g., using Chart.js) to visualize spending patterns and budget adherence.
*   **Reporting:** Generate monthly/yearly spending reports.
*   **Real Notifications:** Implement a proper notification system.
*   **PWA Features:** Add a service worker and manifest file for offline capabilities and installability.
*   **Category Management:** Allow users to add, edit, and delete spending categories.
